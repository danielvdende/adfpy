# Getting Started

## Installation
Installation of adfPy is simple:
```shell
pip install adfpy
```

This will give you:

 - The adfPy classes and functions you need to build awesome pipelines.
 - A CLI command: `adfpy-deploy` which parses your adfPy resource definitions and ensures they are correctly configured in your ADF instance.
